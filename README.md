# Weedy-Rice-Classification-Using-Deep-Learning
A deep learning project to classify weedy rice using AlexNet and DenseNet-121. Built with Streamlit, the prototype allows image uploads for real-time detection. The system helps distinguish weedy rice from healthy crops, supporting smarter, more efficient agricultural practices.
